# Network Behavior Analytics for Graylog

This content pack establishes a GELF input by which AlphaSOC alerts can be sent to Graylog by [Network Flight Recorder (NFR)](https://github.com/alphasoc/nfr), and a dashboard to summarize infected hosts and anomalies within the environment. NFR performs scoring of network traffic (DNS and IP events) which can be collected on the wire, or loaded via Bro IDS, Suricata, or other sources.
